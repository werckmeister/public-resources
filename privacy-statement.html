Privacy policy

Protecting your privacy is important to us. We hope the following statement will help you understand how our app deals with the personal
identifiable information ('PII') you may occasionally provide to us via Internet (the 'Google Play' Platform).

Generally, we do not collect any PII from you when you download our Android applications. To be specific,
we do not require the consumers to get registered before downloading the application, nor do we keep track of the consumers' visits
of our application, we even don't have a Server to store such PII.

Our app provides the functionality of a musical tuner and implements more advanced functions (such as tuning to specific partials,
chord and interval recognition use of custom musical tempers, etc) to users. This functionality is provided as is and no guarantee
is given regarding any fitness for use.

A number of android permissions need to be granted by the user of the app in order to let the app perform its functions. These are 
detailed below:

Our app requires access permissions to the device's microphone. It needs this in order to process incoming audio signals for the sole
purpose of calculating  frequencies contained in the signal. This frequency information is further processed to display tonal information
to the user in the form of notes, chords and frequencies. This is the core functionality of the app. The audio signal recorded by the 
device microphone is not stored on the device not is it leaving the device using any form of transmission.

Our app requires access permission to the devices storage. The app uses the storage for the purpose of storing the app's configuration so
that the app may return to the settings it had prior to closing the app. This information does not contain PII nor does it leave the
device using any form of transmission.

The only situation we may get access to your PII is when you personally decide to email us your feedback or to provide us with a bug report.
The PII we may get from you in that situation are strictly limited to your name, email address and your survey response only.

In above situation, your PII will only be used for contacting you and improving our services.
We will never use such information (e.g. your name and email address) for any other purposes, such as to further market our products,
or to disclose your personal information to a third party for commercial gains.

It should be noted that whether or not to send us your feedback or bug report is a completely voluntary initiative upon your own decision.
If you have concern about your PII being misused, or if you want further information about our privacy policy and what it means,
please feel free to email us at martijnwe@gmail.com, we will endeavor to provide clear answers to your questions in a timely manner.
